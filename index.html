            <h3>Did you know that one in six house fires start in the bedroom?</h3>
            <p>Fires that start in the bedroom are particularly dangerous, as there may be people sleeping and unaware.<br> 
                Here are some simple things you can do to reduce the risk of a fire starting in the bedroom:
            </p>
            <h4>Smoke Alarms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Install long life photoelectric smoke alarms. These are more likely to detect fires quickly than other types of smoke alarms.</li>
                <li>Install smoke alarms in every bedroom in the house, especially if you usually keep bedroom doors shut.</li>
                <li>If this isn't possible, make sure you install a photoelectric smoke alarm in the hallway within 3 metres of the bedrooms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you have the correct bulb size and rating (in watts) fitted in lamps, according to the manufacturer specifications.</li>
                <li>Keep a torch or your phone near the bed, so you can find your way out of the house if it's dark.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Candles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Never leave candles unattended.</li>
                <li>Ensure candles are placed on a surface that won't catch on fire, like a ceramic plate or a special holder.</li>
                <li>Don't let children use, light or play with candles.</li>
                <li>Keep matches, lighters and anything else that can start a fire out of reach of children.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Electric Blankets</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If you use an electric blanket, make sure it lies flat on the bed and the controls or cords are not twisted or caught. Twisted cords are a common cause of electric blanket fires.</li>
                <li>Worn and old electric blankets can cause serious injury. At the first sign of wear, replace the blanket or have it checked by a qualified electrician.</li>
                <li>Never sleep with an electric blanket turned on, even on a low temperature. Always switch it off before you hop into bed.</li>
                <li>If storing an electric blanket off the bed during summer, roll it up rather than fold it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Smoking</h4>
            <p>Never smoke in bed. You may fall asleep while you're smoking and if the cigarette is still alight, it could start a fire.</p>

            <h3>Did you know that one in four house fires start in the kitchen?</h3>
            <p>Making your kitchen fire safe is a really important part of having a fire safe home. Here are some simple things you can do to reduce the risk of a fire starting in the kitchen</p>

            <h4>When you’re cooking</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't drink and fry. Alcohol is involved in half of all fatal fires. 
                    Instead, pre-prepare a meal, get takeaways, or use the microwave. 
                    Never attempt to drink alcohol or take medication that makes you sleepy when cooking.</li>
                <li>Don’t leave the room when cooking. If you have to, always turn off the stove first. 
                    Unattended cooking is the leading cause of house fires in New Zealand.</li>
                <li>Keep curtains, tea towels, oven mitts and any flammable items well away from the cooking area when you're cooking.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Keeping a clean and safe kitchen</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean your stovetop after each use. This prevents spilled fats and burnt foods from building up.</li>
                <li>Clean rangehood filters regularly.</li>
                <li>Keep a fire extinguisher and a fire blanket somewhere in your kitchen. Make sure you know how to use them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Smoke alarms</h4>
            <p>Don't install a smoke alarm in your kitchen. Smoke and heat from cooking (and the toaster) can activate the alarm.
                Smoke alarms shouldn't be installed in the bathroom or laundry either.<br><br>
                You can still protect these areas with a heat alarm. A heat alarm is designed to activate when the room reaches a set temperature. 
                They are useful in places where a smoke alarm would usually give false alarms.
            </p>
            <h4>If a fire starts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If your frypan is on fire, place the lid of the frypan, a wet tea towel, or another large flat object (like a chopping board) over the pan to starve the fire of oxygen.</li>
                <li>Never throw water onto a frypan that's on fire.</li>
                <li>Never, ever attempt to carry a burning frypan outside.</li>
                <li>If you have a fire in your oven, try to turn off the power or gas, either at the stove or at the mains.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Preventing scalds</h4>
            <p>Another big danger in the kitchen is scalds — burns caused by boiling water. Here are some tips for preventing scalds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep kids out of the kitchen or cooking areas when you're cooking or preparing meals.</li>
                <li>Keep kettles, jugs and teapots away from the edge of benches and tables.</li>
                <li>Turn saucepan handles so they're not sticking out over the floor. Use the elements or hot plates at the back of the stove if possible.</li>
                <li>Make sure all upright stoves are securely fastened to the wall and keep oven doors closed, except when grilling as per manufacturers instructions.</li>

            <h3>Do you have an escape plan?</h3>
            <p>Did you know a house fire can kill you in less than three minutes? <br>
                In a fire, you'll probably be scared and disorientated. Toxic smoke might make it hard to breathe and see clearly.<br><br>
                You will only have 1 or 2 minutes from the sounding of the smoke alarm to when your life is seriously threatened by fire or smoke.<br><br>
                That's why it's essential to have an escape plan in place, to practice it regularly, and to know how to get to safety quickly.
            </p>
            <h4>Build your escape plan</h4>
            <p>To build your escape plan, we will ask you to think about: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smoke alarms in your home.</li>
                <li>How you will make sure everyone in the household gets out.</li>
                <li>A safe place where everyone will meet.</li>
                <li>What are your best and alternative ways out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Take three minutes now to create your escape plan now, so you can escape then.</p>
