            <p>
                Many Kiwi homes have a gas-powered BBQ outside. These are great for cooking during the summer, but can also pose a fire risk if not stored and maintained correctly.<br><br>
                Here are some tips for reducing the risk of fire when using BBQs and gas cylinders.
            </p>
            <h4>The soap bubble test</h4>
            <p>
                A common cause of BBQ fires is gas leaking from where the BBQ hose fits into the cylinder valve.<br>
                Whenever you connect a gas cylinder to a BBQ, make sure it's hand tight. 
                You can do this by turning the gas cylinder on, and then pouring a little soapy solution 
                (1/4 cup of water and a squirt of liquid suds) over the valve.<br>
                If any bubbles are created you may have a gas leak. Turn the valve off and replace the cylinder O-ring.
            </p>
            <h4>BBQs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>BBQs are potentially dangerous when used carelessly or when consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. 
                    Treat your BBQ the same way you would a stove: don't drink and fry, and avoid leaving cooking unattended.</li>
                <li>Ensure you regularly check and maintain any fittings and connections. Use the soap bubble test to make sure there are no leaks.</li>
                <li>Leave plenty of clear space around the BBQ. Make sure there is no nearby debris that could catch fire.</li>
                <li>Supervise children at all times when using the BBQ.</li>
                <li>Remove all excess fat from the BBQ after each use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Gas cylinders</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the soap bubble test to make sure gas cylinders are secure and not leaking.</li>
                <li>Make sure the cylinder is turned off when you've finished using it.</li>
                <li>Have all gas appliances serviced according to manufacturer instructions.</li>
                <li>Store and install cylinders in an upright position.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Did you know that one in six house fires start in the bedroom?</h3>
                <span class="iconify exit" data-icon="emojione-v1:heavy-multiplication-x" data-width="32"></span>
            </div>
            <p>Fires that start in the bedroom are particularly dangerous, as there may be people sleeping and unaware.<br> 
                Here are some simple things you can do to reduce the risk of a fire starting in the bedroom:
            </p>
            <h4>Smoke Alarms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Install long life photoelectric smoke alarms. These are more likely to detect fires quickly than other types of smoke alarms.</li>
                <li>Install smoke alarms in every bedroom in the house, especially if you usually keep bedroom doors shut.</li>
                <li>If this isn't possible, make sure you install a photoelectric smoke alarm in the hallway within 3 metres of the bedrooms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Lighting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you have the correct bulb size and rating (in watts) fitted in lamps, according to the manufacturer specifications.</li>
                <li>Keep a torch or your phone near the bed, so you can find your way out of the house if it's dark.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Candles</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Never leave candles unattended.</li>
                <li>Ensure candles are placed on a surface that won't catch on fire, like a ceramic plate or a special holder.</li>
                <li>Don't let children use, light or play with candles.</li>
                <li>Keep matches, lighters and anything else that can start a fire out of reach of children.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Electric Blankets</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If you use an electric blanket, make sure it lies flat on the bed and the controls or cords are not twisted or caught. Twisted cords are a common cause of electric blanket fires.</li>
                <li>Worn and old electric blankets can cause serious injury. At the first sign of wear, replace the blanket or have it checked by a qualified electrician.</li>
                <li>Never sleep with an electric blanket turned on, even on a low temperature. Always switch it off before you hop into bed.</li>
                <li>If storing an electric blanket off the bed during summer, roll it up rather than fold it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Smoking</h4>
            <p>Never smoke in bed. You may fall asleep while you're smoking and if the cigarette is still alight, it could start a fire.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Making your kitchen fire safe is a really important part of having a fire safe home. Here are some simple things you can do to reduce the risk of a fire starting in the kitchen</p>

            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <h4>When you’re cooking</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't drink and fry. Alcohol is involved in half of all fatal fires. 
                    Instead, pre-prepare a meal, get takeaways, or use the microwave. 
                    Never attempt to drink alcohol or take medication that makes you sleepy when cooking.</li>
                <li>Don’t leave the room when cooking. If you have to, always turn off the stove first. 
                    Unattended cooking is the leading cause of house fires in New Zealand.</li>
                <li>Keep curtains, tea towels, oven mitts and any flammable items well away from the cooking area when you're cooking.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Keeping a clean and safe kitchen</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean your stovetop after each use. This prevents spilled fats and burnt foods from building up.</li>
                <li>Clean rangehood filters regularly.</li>
                <li>Keep a fire extinguisher and a fire blanket somewhere in your kitchen. Make sure you know how to use them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Smoke alarms</h4>
            <p>Don't install a smoke alarm in your kitchen. Smoke and heat from cooking (and the toaster) can activate the alarm.
                Smoke alarms shouldn't be installed in the bathroom or laundry either.<br><br>
                You can still protect these areas with a heat alarm. A heat alarm is designed to activate when the room reaches a set temperature. 
                They are useful in places where a smoke alarm would usually give false alarms.
            </p>
            <h4>If a fire starts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If your frypan is on fire, place the lid of the frypan, a wet tea towel, or another large flat object (like a chopping board) over the pan to starve the fire of oxygen.</li>
                <li>Never throw water onto a frypan that's on fire.</li>
                <li>Never, ever attempt to carry a burning frypan outside.</li>
                <li>If you have a fire in your oven, try to turn off the power or gas, either at the stove or at the mains.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Preventing scalds</h4>
            <p>Another big danger in the kitchen is scalds — burns caused by boiling water. Here are some tips for preventing scalds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep kids out of the kitchen or cooking areas when you're cooking or preparing meals.</li>
                <li>Keep kettles, jugs and teapots away from the edge of benches and tables.</li>
                <li>Turn saucepan handles so they're not sticking out over the floor. Use the elements or hot plates at the back of the stove if possible.</li>
                <li>Make sure all upright stoves are securely fastened to the wall and keep oven doors closed, except when grilling as per manufacturers instructions.</li>

            <p>Did you know a house fire can kill you in less than three minutes? <br>
                In a fire, you'll probably be scared and disorientated. Toxic smoke might make it hard to breathe and see clearly.<br><br>
                You will only have 1 or 2 minutes from the sounding of the smoke alarm to when your life is seriously threatened by fire or smoke.<br><br>
                That's why it's essential to have an escape plan in place, to practice it regularly, and to know how to get to safety quickly.
            </p>
            <h4>Build your escape plan</h4>
            <p>To build your escape plan, we will ask you to think about: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smoke alarms in your home.</li>
                <li>How you will make sure everyone in the household gets out.</li>
                <li>A safe place where everyone will meet.</li>
                <li>What are your best and alternative ways out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Take three minutes now to create your escape plan now, so you can escape then.</p>

            <p>Fire and Emergency New Zealand recommend long-life photoelectric smoke alarms.</p>

            <h4>Photoelectric and Interconnected smoke alarms</h4>
            <p>
                Fire and Emergency New Zealand recommend long-life photoelectric smoke alarms. 
                They are far more effective than ionisation alarms at detecting slow smouldering fires, which burn for hours before bursting into flames.<br><br>
                Better yet, choose a set of photoelectric smoke alarms that can be connected to each other via Bluetooth technology, or wiring together. 
                If a fire is detected in one room of the house, interconnected alarms will trigger all the alarms in your home, so everyone will be alerted to a fire sooner. 
                This is especially important in multi-storey homes and homes with long hallways.
            </p>
            <h4>Make sure you have long-life batteries</h4>
            <p>
                The great thing is, most smoke alarms now come with a built-in, sealed, long-life battery, which will last as long as the smoke alarm – about ten years. 
                That’s a big improvement on the old 9-volt batteries, which are cheaper but will start ‘chirping’ to be replaced after about one year. 
                If you have a smoke alarm with an old 9-volt battery, it’s time to upgrade to a long-life photoelectric alarm.
            </p>
            <h4>Hard-wired smoke alarms</h4>
            <p>
                Some smoke alarms can be wired into your home’s power or security system. 
                But you will still need a back-up battery installed in case of a power cut, 
                and installation will be more involved (and costly) as you will need an electrician to run wiring to each location.
            </p>
            <h4>Smoke alarms for deaf or hard of hearing</h4>
            <p>
                If you’re deaf or hard of hearing, there are specialised smoke alarm systems with extra features such as extra loud and/or lower pitch alarm sounds, 
                flashing strobe lights, or vibrating devices. Having hard-wired, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms fitted alongside bed-shakers and/or strobe lights is ideal.

            <h4>Landlord or tenant? Who is responsible for smoke alarms</h4>
            <p>
                Both landlords and tenants are responsible. The landlord is responsible to ensure there are working smoke alarms in every rental, 
                and to replace any smoke alarms that no longer work with new photoelectric ones. If the rental has an older alarm with a 9-Volt battery, 
                replacing the battery is the tenant’s responsibility.

            <h3>Where should I put smoke alarms?</h3>
            <p>
                Fire and Emergency New Zealand recommend installing a smoke alarm in every bedroom, hallway and living area. 
                You may also choose to install a heat alarm in the kitchen, laundry, bathroom or garage.
            </p>

            <h4>Important things to consider</h4>
            <p>
                Don't put a smoke alarm in your kitchen, where smoke from cooking could set it off, use a heat alarm here instead.<br><br>
                Smoke alarms cannot detect smoke through a closed door, so think carefully about the layout of your home.
            </p>
            <h4>Required property requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Your landlord must install a smoke alarm:
                <ul>
                    <li>within 3 metres of each bedroom door, or in every room where a person sleeps</li>
                    <li>in each level or story of a multi-story or multi-level home</li>
                    <li>in all rental homes, boarding houses, rental caravans, and self-contained sleep-outs.</li>
                </ul>
